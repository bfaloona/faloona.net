<br>
The man my heart considered a father, Dr. Gerald R. Faloona, has passed away. I
have felt such a surge of sadness pressing into&nbsp;my heart and through my
body. I feel lost, emotionally. He was a role model to me, a kind loving and
strong man. He was so non&nbsp;traditional, at one part of his life he was among
those who could be considered for a Nobel prize for his biological research, at&nbsp;another
he carried a plate through the food line at the Salvation army. Exploring the
ends to which life could go was his path and&nbsp;he did. Perhaps now he is just
exploring what it is not to live?<br>
<br>
He opened his life, family and love for me as no other Man had ever done. He
respectfully expressed a guiding opinion as if&nbsp;each one, a gift&nbsp;of
comfort and ease my journey through life. He smiled like no other man could
smile, so young in form like&nbsp; that of a boy, pure and innocent. His kind
and wise eyes could drive the room to deeper existence, whether comfortable or
not he&nbsp;took us there. I believe he knew this was his power in life. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">He loved me where my
biological father never did. When I arrived or left he held me in a hugging
embrace where my biological&nbsp;father never could. When he shook my hand it
felt like he was settling a deal where I was now considered loved in the eyes of&nbsp;God’s
pure love in exchange for just being. Was he God's agent? He joked and played
with me as a pal, a comrade, a drinking&nbsp;bud (even though I never would
drink with him) with respect for me as a human and part of his earthly family of
Homo Sapiens.<br>
<br>
Science was his filter for seeing the world. This we shared before we ever met
and allowed us a common language. Though I&nbsp;know science never , never
separated him from the spirit of living and family. He walked through life as a
scientist, yet under&nbsp;such clothing was a man questing the true spirit of
our purpose here. Once he gave me his Ph.D. diploma. He covered up his name&nbsp;and
put mine. In this one silly and playful act he gave me all the acknowledgment I
would ever need from an authority.<br>
<br>
My heart now aches needing ground to be on where there is now only memories.<br>
<br>
Love is so blind. It can not see gender, race, age, profession, and all
adjectives and forms our frail human mind can come up with&nbsp;as a separator
between us and the reality of connectivity between all things. Sometimes I feel
my heart was ignored by Love when&nbsp;I was a child, so I have a hard reaction
to receiving love. The freedom to give Love is where I feel most comfortable.
With Gerry I&nbsp;could loosen the hardness for Love to flow in. He helped
balance me. He was blind to many things in life only because he was so full of
Love.<br>
<br>
Selemat Hintu dan Jiwa, Selemat Jalan, Bapak Gerry! (Blessings on your spirit
and soul, Blessings on your Journey, Father Gerry)<br>
<br>
I only pray that I may be so blind.<br>
