<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>My
feelings for Gerry are very simple and straightforward, in spite of the fact
that he was a rather complicated guy and I have my own share of hard edges and
high standards for both myself and others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Gerry and I had a great relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>There was nothing difficult or conflicted in the way we felt for each
other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was unconditional and
absolute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman'>For numerous periods
during our time together these last 34 years, our relationship was one that was
expressed primarily in phone conversations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It started when I was very young after Freddi and Gerry separated, and
we had regularly scheduled calls on Sunday evenings. And for the last 10 years
or so, we’ve spoken most evenings at pre-arranged half-hour windows.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The calls were important to him, they were
for set times, and I took them as a commitment. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><font face="Verdana" size="2">I know Jack and perhaps others who observed my adherence
to these scheduled nightly calls, might have seen these as examples of me
acting in an obligatory way and Gerry being dependent on me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because you can imagine the scene, Skylers’
hungry, Zoey’s fussy, dinner is about to go on the table, and all of a sudden I
look at the clock and go into the other room to call Dad because the time
window is about to end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But I’ve always
known that I was the one who got the greatest reward out of these calls.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each conversation was an excuse to wallow in
the love that he poured on me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And
above all else -- like the pecks he gave for kisses, his dry humor, and the way
he rolled his eyes – it’s these calls that I am going to miss the most.</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman'>There are some
precious, though admittedly painfully precious things about the last month and
a half that I am grateful for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One,
that we got to say goodbye to him, and to know that he was surrounded by love
when he died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My relationship with my
brother was forever deepened as I witnessed him take such extraordinarily
tender care of our Dad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My husband,
whose strength I rely on everyday, was willing and so able to dive in and
handle any aspect of what we needed during this time.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>He’s known since the beginning that along with me, comes Gerry,
and that includes whatever long-term care and living arrangements are
required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I got to see my mother <i>again</i>
be the glue that holds our totally unique and wonderful family together.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And I am humbled and awestruck and moved
beyond words at the loving way my mother, my father and my step-father have
honored their ex-spouses and the new expanded families that got created in the
process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And Dad was so proud and
interested in all of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ron’s kids,
both sets, Brandon and Me, and Trev Jr. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in'><font face="Verdana" size="2">Last night Brandon,
Freddi, Dierge, Ian and I sat around talking about that amazing and wonderful aspect of
Gerry that almost reverently honored family ties.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>There was a sweetness and purity to his family devotions that I
am really looking forward to learning how to carry that onward, on through to
my children and hopefully through them, for generations to come.</font></p>
