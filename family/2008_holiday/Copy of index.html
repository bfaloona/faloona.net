<span style="padding: 30px"><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We continue to feel
somewhat overwhelmed by life with 2 toddlers &ndash; but what a sweet
life it is...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Our co-housing
community has proved to be a great place to raise a family.  We share
weekly dinners with other families with young kids and several meals
a month with the entire community.  In many ways it feels like an
old-fashioned small-town neighborhood where folks really know and
care what's going on with each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There's a lot of music
in our house; Azure loves to improvise songs or sing his favorites,
like The Lion Sleeps Tonight and I've Been Working on the Railroad &ndash;
and now Jingle Bells.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brandon's company has
changed hands yet again &ndash; bought back by the original owners. 
So although the company has a new name, not a whole lot has changed
day to day.  We're told the billing software product is relatively
recession-proof, and Brandon's contributions are sufficiently valued,
so we're feeling fortunate that his job is quite secure, at least for
now.  Thankfully we're managing to get by with one income for the
indefinite future.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Spring, Kristen,
Azure and Theo joined a mom and tots group called Little Peppers.  We
continue to meet weekly with some of the families from the class. 
And in September both boys started Co-op Preschool at the nearby
community college.  Azure attends 2 mornings a week, one with mom and
one without.  And Theo and Brandon go together Saturday mornings. 
It's been a great learning experience for all of us.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All in all it's been a
busy year, focused almost entirely on raising the boys.  While we're
often sad that none of our family lives nearby, we feel doubly
blessed to have a terrific community here in Seattle as well as a
wonderfully supportive family dispersed across the country.  Below is
a chronology of some highlights of the year, which are also featured
in the slide show.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dallas &amp; Kate
visited in January '08.  We're looking forward to seeing them again
in January '09 and to visiting their new Bed and Breakfast in
Talkeetna, Alaska.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Azure's 2nd
birthday (March 6th)  he had a puzzle party to share his love for
puzzles with his friends.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Brandon and
Kristen turned 40 &ndash; In March we had a surprise party for
Brandon with lots of out of town family.  And in April we celebrated
Kristen's 40th by going to Olympia, WA for the Procession of the
Species. This playful parade is sure to become an annual tradition
for us!</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In May there was a big
family gathering in Albuquerque for Angelo's graduation &ndash; both
sides of our family were there! What a stellar young man Angelo is
becoming.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In July Brandon's
cousin Ian was married in Boulder.  It was a beautiful outdoor
wedding and many of us stayed at Chautauqua Park &ndash; just like
being at summer camp!</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shortly after that we
took a big trip to the east coast  in August. On the 17th, Theo and
Freddi celebrated their shared birthday with lots of family on Cape
Cod.  We then spent a week in NY visiting Bill and Helene where we
were able to see Mary and Phil as well as Kristen's college friend
Vicki with her husband Karel and daughter Olivia.  Our boys loved the
little beach and the big trees at Grandpa's lake house.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">October was a
whirlwind!  Brandon took his first solo trip since Azure was born,
flying to SF to visit Wade and to celebrate Uncle Ron's 70th
birthday.  Kristen and Theo went to the Balloon Fiesta in Albuquerque
and had some great cousin time with Tessa and Tony.  Kristen
re-engaged with the radio station, volunteering for their pledge
drive while Brandon phoned and canvased for the Obama campaign.
Before we knew it, Halloween was upon us and then election day!  In
the end, after months of saying &ldquo;Yes We Can!&rdquo; and
pointing out Obama signs, Azure switched his &ldquo;vote&rdquo; to
Dawson, his two year-old neighbor. In all seriousness though,
November 4th was a night of profound joy and relief for our family
and community of friends. We are filled with hope for our country
like never before. 
</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We had a lovely
Thanksgiving here in Seattle.  We enjoyed dinner with our co-housing
community and also went &ldquo;camping&rdquo; in our neighborhood
park on a cold sunny day. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now it's off to L.A.
For Christmas with Brandon's family.  And this year we'll be joined
by Bill and Helene as well!  And maybe another appearance by Santa
Trevor???</P>
