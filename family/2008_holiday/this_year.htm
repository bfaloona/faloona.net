This playful parade is sure to become an annual tradition for us!</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">In May there was a big family gathering in Albuquerque for Angelo's graduation – both sides of our family were there! What a stellar young man Angelo is becoming.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">In July Brandon's cousin Ian was married in Boulder.  It was a beautiful outdoor wedding and many of us stayed at Chautauqua Park – just like being at summer camp!</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Shortly after that we took a big trip to the east coast  in August. On the 17<span class="T1">th</span>, Theo and Freddi celebrated their shared birthday with lots of family on Cape Cod.  We then spent a week in NY visiting Bill and Helene where we were able to see Mary and Phil as well as Kristen's college friend Vicki with her husband Karel and daughter Olivia.  Our boys loved the little beach and the big trees at Grandpa's lake house.</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">October was a whirlwind!  Brandon took his first solo trip since Azure was born, flying to SF to visit Wade and to celebrate Uncle Ron's 70<span class="T1">th</span> birthday.  Kristen and Theo went to the Balloon Fiesta in Albuquerque and had some great cousin time with Tessa and Tony.  Kristen re-engaged with the radio station, volunteering for their pledge drive while Brandon phoned and canvased for the Obama campaign. Before we knew it, Halloween was upon us and then election day!  In the end, after months of saying “Yes We Can!” and pointing out Obama signs, Azure switched his “vote” to Dawson, his two year-old neighbor. In all seriousness though, November 4<span class="T1">th</span> was a night of profound joy and relief for our family and community of friends. We are filled with hope for our country like never before. </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">We had a lovely Thanksgiving here in Seattle.  We enjoyed dinner with our co-housing community and also went “camping” in our neighborhood park on a cold sunny day. </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">Now it's off to L.A. For Christmas with Brandon's family.  And this year we'll be joined by Bill and Helene as well!  And maybe another appearance by Santa Trevor???</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">We hope ...</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
