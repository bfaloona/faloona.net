<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana" size="2">Memories of My Friend Gerald Faloona, by David Card</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana" size="2"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>I first met Gerry in the early 70’s
when he would frequent my bar, Bo’s Place, just around the corner from the
“Hall House”. Being the friendly and intelligent person Gerry was, we soon
became fast friends. It was through him that I met and enjoyed the rest of the
people in that house. I eventually moved into a vacancy in the house, and with
Gerry’s room being adjacent to mine, our friendship flourished. We did
frolicking and fun things together, many of which I cannot mention here and
some I will never admit to. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it!</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana" size="2"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>During most of the 70’s and the
early 80’s we were close buddies, culminating in my asking Gerry to be best man
at my wedding in October 1984. Marriage and kids has a way of changing a single
man’s habits and our lives gradually took diverging courses.</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana" size="2">I want to
mention the things I liked about Gerry: he was generous, articulate,
politically active, fun-loving, gregarious, kind, a caring father and a good friend.
Another thing I liked about him was there wasn’t much to dislike about Gerry.</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gerry was
Bo’s Place resident “Santa Claus” each year during our Christmas party for
kids. If memory serves, we once managed to get him to enter the building
through the attic, thus simulating a “chimney drop”. After much exertion coming
down the “chimney,” Santa was asked what he wanted. His reply, “Santa wants a
Budweiser”. We gave him two.</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana" size="2">Life has a
way of dealing bad hands to everyone from time to time and Gerry was no
exception. After he moved to California, our contact became minimal, if not
non-existent. He called me once about 7 or 8 months ago. I returned the call
once but did not persist. Now I regret it. But Gerry was the kind of person who
could forgive, so I feel his understanding as I write this remembrance.</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana" size="2"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>His passing
scares me. It brings once again into focus my own mortality and the passage of
time. Gerry and I discussed these things many times; he was not afraid to
express his feelings, he would patiently listen to me whining about my fears,
hopes, dreams, frustrations and economic insecurities. Then we would go to Bo’s
Place and have a cold beer.</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana" size="2"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>It’s
difficult losing a good friend, whatever the circumstance. A little piece of us
dies with them and we are left to carry on. There is one advantage to going
first; in that spiritual realm where I need the most representation, Gerry
Faloona is already there. I hope and expect he’s where he is, lobbying for my
forgiveness, and the forgiveness of all of his friends, for he had many who may
need his political clout and experience with the one who counts. So goodbye,
Gerry, good buddy. My life is better because you were in it. Thanks.</font></p>
